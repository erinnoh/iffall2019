  <li>I am Erin Noh, a junior majoring in Communication Design.</li>
  <li>Although I am essentially taking Interaction Foundations because it is a required course, I have always wanted to learn the basics of HTML and CSS because I know it is a useful skill to learn.</li>
  <li>I do not have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</li>
  <li>I hope to acquire a basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS and feel more comfortable about incorporating the functions into design projects.</li>
  <li>Designs for the screen allow for more dynamic and engaging experiences that are created by video/audio elements, or other interactive options that can be changed or redesigned anytime. For print, the experience is less interactive, and cannot be changed as easily.</li>
  <li>https://www.weberous.com/ has effective design because the moving graphics and lively visual effects capture the attention of the viewer and keep them engaged. The consistent color scheme and typefaces also create unity within the web design.</li>
  <li>https://www.behance.net/ demonstrates effective communication as the image-based website successfully delivers its purpose of encouraging people to discover and share creative work. In particular, the clearly categorized content facilitates user navigation.</li>
  <li>https://www.apple.com/ is a minimalistic website that works well because of its simplicity and clarity. The visual language of the site strongly aligns with its brand image, and the balance between images and text makes the content easier to follow through.</li>
