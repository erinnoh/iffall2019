<p>Grace Patricia Kelly was born on November 12, 1929, at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to an affluent and influential family. She grew up in a small, close-knit Catholic community. While attending Ravenhill Academy, a reputable Catholic girls’ school, Kelly modeled fashions at local charity events with her mother and sisters. Before graduating in May 1947 from Stevens School, a socially prominent private institution in nearby Chestnut Hill, she acted and danced.</br></br>

After embarking on an acting career in 1950 when she was 20, Kelly appeared in New York City theatrical productions and more than 40 episodes of live drama productions broadcast during the early 1950s Golden Age of Television. Kelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as Princess of Monaco. She is listed 13th among the American Film Institute’s 25 Greatest Female Stars of Classical Hollywood Cinema.</p>
