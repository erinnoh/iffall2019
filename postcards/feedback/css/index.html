  <h1> Postcard Triptych Feedback </h1>
  <h2> FOR CAMRYN COGSHELL </h2>

  <body>

    <b>Postcard #1</b></br>
    - Very clear contrast and good legibility </br>
  - Nice framing when the desktop version is modified into the mobile version </br>
  - I like how you used the same color from his shirt for his name</br>
  - Maybe add a period at the end of the quote</br></br>

      <b>Postcard #2</b></br>
      - Very effective use of color and typeface choice</br>
  - Bring down the quote a little more down towards the middle for the mobile version</br>
  - The two orange rectangles framing the quote changing from a vertical to horizontal format might be a dramatic change </br>
  - Increase size of text a little more for the mobile version</br></br>

    <b> Postcard #3</b></br>
    - Add source/reference of quote</br>
  - Add period to the end of the sentence</br>
  - Maybe bring down the image and text more towards middle/bottom for the mobile version</br>
  - Try having the gradient come from bottom to top for the mobile version or keep the horizontal gradient but have the darker tint extend in more</br>
